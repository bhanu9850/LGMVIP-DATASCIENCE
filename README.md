image to pencil sketch with python

The process involves converting the image into a grayscale image and then applying a Gaussian blur to the image. After that, I used the Dodge and Burn method to enhance the highlights and shadows of the image, resulting in a pencil sketch effect.

This project was a great way to explore image processing using Python and the OpenCV library. It required knowledge of image manipulation and various techniques to achieve the desired effect. I gained experience in applying filters, adjusting image contrast, and applying image transformation techniques.
